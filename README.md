# Natural-Language-Processing
In this repo, I have covered preprocessing by,

Cleaning: Remove irrelevant items like HTML tags, symbols, and nonalphabetic characters from the corpus (Data set in NLP)

Normalization: Convert all words to lowercase and remove punctuation and extra spaces.

Tokenization: Split the text into words, also known as tokens.

Stop Words Removal: Remove the most common words (a, an, the, etc.).

Parts of Speech Tagging: Identify the parts of speech for the remaining words.

Named Entity Recognition: Recognize the named entities in the data.

Stemming and Lemmatisation: Convert words into dictionary forms, using stemming
and lemmatization.

Applications,

-> Speech-to-text conversion
-> Text Preprocessing
-> Language Modelling 
-> Language Translation
